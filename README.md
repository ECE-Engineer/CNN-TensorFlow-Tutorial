# CNN-TensorFlow-Tutorial
A simple CNN tutorial prepared for the SUNY Oswego TensorFlow workshop &amp; talk.

## Preparation
Please make sure you have python 2 or 3 installed. If not go to the python website for the installation.
Please make sure you have the correct version of pip installed.
Please go to the tensorflow website and install the appropriate version of tensorflow.

## Datasets
We will be using the MNIST dataset, which is comprised of grayscale images of digits [0-9].
